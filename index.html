<!-- 
1. Start on the master branch. Make an HTML page and link a CSS file to it. Add a title and
a couple paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum. Commit that.
2. Create a “red” branch. Add CSS to add some red to the page. Make sure to commit it on
the red branch, not the master.
3. Go back to the master branch and refresh your page. Notice that the red colors are
gone.
4. Create a new branch called footer. Add a footer to the HTML, but don’t style it. Commit
this to the footer branch.
5. Go to the reds branch and refresh your page. Notice that the footer is gone and the red
color is back.
6. Go to the master branch and merge the footer into it.
7. Go to the red branch and merge master into it. (It’s usually a good idea to keep your
branch up-to-date with master.)
8. Go to master and create a “big” branch. Increase the font size on the page via CSS and
commit it on the “big” branch.
9. Go to master and merge red into it.
10. Go to big and merge master into it. You will probably get a conflict on the CSS file. Fix
the conflict and commit the merge. -->
